                                <p class="text-justify">He encountered the masked man shortly after graduating from university.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">That day, like any other, he was exhausted from job hunting. After a failed interview, instead of heading home, he wandered into a bar late at night.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">A man wearing a strange mask walked straight toward him, as if he were the only one in the crowd who noticed this out-of-place figure.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Want to be him?" The masked man pointed to the TV, where an entrepreneur was speaking confidently. "On the Forbes list—he makes billions in just a minute."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He let out a mocking laugh and took a large gulp of whiskey. "Of course I do, but that's just a pipe dream."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The man's eyes, dark and intense, stared at him through the mask's gaps. "It's possible."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He mentally labeled him a lunatic.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"You have time. Plenty of time. We can make an exchange." The masked man extended his hand, showing a number. "Ten days."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Ten days?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Ten days of your life, and you can live one day as him—rich, reckless, without a care in the world," the man said. "Of course, during those ten days, your own life will go on as usual. It won't disrupt anything."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"A good deal, don't you think?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The masked man spoke.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">It sounded too absurd. He nodded absentmindedly, just wanting to get rid of the lunatic. The masked man bowed slightly and quietly left.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The next morning, he woke up in a luxurious room. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, he could see a beautiful private garden.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He had actually become that billionaire.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Jackpot! He thought, ecstatic. Trading his boring and mundane life for an experience like this was the best deal in the world.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">That day, he did many things he had never dared to imagine. As night fell, he felt it was the greatest day of his life.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But after experiencing a day like that, his previously peaceful life became unbearable.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He longed to meet the masked man again, so he returned to the bar.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Just like before, the masked man walked straight toward him, ignoring the crowd around him.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">This time, he became a world-famous actor.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">…</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Days passed, and he made many such "deals." He lived the lives of countless people—the smartest, the most beautiful, the wealthiest, the most famous. He greedily indulged in these extraordinary lives, eager to exchange all his time for more of these experiences.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">After all, he could no longer endure even a single day of his dull life.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Unnoticed by him, his hair had started turning gray. He found himself moving more slowly. One day, his colleague informed him that it was his retirement day, but he realized he barely recognized the coworkers he'd spent forty years with.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">When he returned home, his son was there, and he suddenly realized that his son had become a middle-aged man, while his wife's back had begun to stoop.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He sat on the sofa for a long time, feeling tired. That day, he went to the bar and told the masked man:</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"I want to buy a day as a homeless person."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The masked man replied, "Sure, the price is a month."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He thought the man had made a mistake. But the masked man just quietly watched him. In the end, he said, "Alright."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">And so, he wandered aimlessly again for some time.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He didn't know how the masked man set the prices, but that was how it worked. The life of a writer or a traveler cost more than that of a billionaire, and the life of a homeless person cost more than that of a president.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">One day, when he returned home, he was greeted by a bouquet of white flowers and his wife's portrait.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He suddenly remembered that the last time he returned from someone else's life, his wife had been gaunt, sitting on the hospital bed with her head tilted, looking at him. She had said, "You know, even though we've been together for over forty years, I feel like I never really knew you."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">At the funeral, the masked man was there too, standing in front of him, wearing a white flower on his chest.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He strode over to him and said, "I want to buy back my own life. The day when I first met my wife, shortly after I started college."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The masked man nodded. "Sir, I must remind you, this purchase will cost you all the time you have left, because the price for buying back a day of your own life is—"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Ten years."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">…</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He opened his eyes again, and cherry blossoms were fluttering outside the dormitory window.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Today was his first game with the university basketball team, a game in which he had been full of confidence and had won. There was a long-haired girl cheering for him, who later became his wife.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Everything that day was just as he remembered.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">After the game, he saw the girl walking toward him, her eyes bright.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">His heart raced. He was supposed to take the bottle of water she handed him, and then they would talk, get to know each other, and fall in love.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But he suddenly recalled the image of his wife at the end of her life, curled up on the hospital bed. This was his life, and everything would follow the same predetermined path. He would meet the masked man and eventually become a stranger to himself.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">This was his life. The only one he could change.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He stopped walking.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">…</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">It was a spring morning many years ago, the moment when he and his wife fell in love at first sight. He pretended not to notice the smiling face looking at him.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He walked past her.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Only a few cherry blossoms drifted down above their heads.</p>
                                <p class="text-center">

                                    When Bai Ye woke up, the first thing she felt was that she was "brand new."
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Like an old camera that had been refurbished.
                                </p>

                            <div class="writing-full-content">
                                <p class="text-justify">When Bai Ye woke up, the first thing she felt was that she was "brand new."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Like an old camera that had been refurbished.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">It was a feeling difficult to describe, though everything seemed so ordinary and familiar.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">It was a typical winter day in Beijing. The soft sunlight outside the window fell on the down duvet, and it was snowing outside.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Clear sky snow—a rare and beautiful day.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">…</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Walking out of the bedroom, the strange feeling hadn't disappeared.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">If she had to describe it, it felt like the fascia inside her body had been replaced with some kind of artificial, more delicate and flexible membrane, although this material was almost a 100% match to the human structure.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">It must be an illusion.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye shook her head, trying to ignore the sensation. She took two eggs from the fridge, whisked them in a bowl, and then poured a little oil into the pan. The eggs quickly turned into golden scrambled eggs.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She also warmed two cups of milk. Her husband, Yun Yifan, came out of the bedroom, and the two of them had breakfast together.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan ate quickly, finishing the eggs in a few bites. He hugged Bai Ye and said, "Goodbye, Ah Ye! Have a good day at work!"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Then he hurriedly ran off to the basement.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Sometimes Bai Ye envied her husband. He lived so simply, with almost a kind of obsession, firmly believing that everything he did would make the world a better place.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She remembered her doctoral advisor once telling her, "Bai Ye, you always overthink things, worrying about hurting this or that person. But every step of human progress comes with sacrifices."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"For a grand goal, even the entire human society must pay an unprecedented price."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">That was the pain of human progress.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">At the time, Bai Ye had remained silent.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye took a taxi to work, clutching an envelope in her hand.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Inside was her resignation letter.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The company had already signed a contract with the military to use the nano-filament developed by her project for warfare.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye had protested multiple times, but the higher-ups ignored her warnings.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">It was only after she tendered her resignation that the company sent someone to negotiate with her.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Their tone was incredulous.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Professor Bai Ye, you must know the price they're offering could catapult our company into the Fortune 100 overnight. And if you wish, your salary could be ten times, a hundred times what it is now."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye repeatedly told them it wasn't about the money.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"What if they use this technology for mass slaughter? A single nano-filament could slice a city in half like a wedge of cheese—buildings, organisms, humans, everything would become chunks of flesh. Can't you see that?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"They've promised to only use this technology to disrupt communications."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The negotiator's tone was so cold that Bai Ye's blood nearly froze.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"You mean to say those war machines will obediently follow this piece of paper?" Bai Ye pinched the corner of the agreement, the white sheet fluttering like a feather.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Professor Bai Ye, I believe they will."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">…</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">After several rounds of negotiations, Bai Ye decided to resign.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She was one of the core researchers of the project. While her departure wouldn't halt it entirely, it would certainly delay progress by a significant margin.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But ten minutes later, Bai Ye received an entirely unexpected piece of news.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The company representative told her that all agreements involving the military's use of nano-filaments had been terminated and that the company had publicly announced it would not sell any similar licenses in the future.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The nano-filament project would proceed as originally intended, for medical and environmental purposes.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye could tell the representative was just as puzzled as she was.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">After reviewing all the documents, Bai Ye confirmed the information's authenticity.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She asked, "It wasn't because of me, was it?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But she knew in her heart that while she was important, she wasn't important enough for the company to forfeit such a lucrative deal for her sake.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Of course not," the representative shook his head. "The chairman made the decision...no one really understands why."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye remained a bit dizzy for the rest of her workday.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">As she left work, snow was still falling. The sunset looked like a salted egg yolk, casting a dreamlike glow over the city. Perhaps because her state of mind had changed, Bai Ye felt as if every passerby smiled at her warmly.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She decided to walk home. It was only a 20-minute journey, and it wasn't cold at all.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She even received a phone call along the way, informing her that she had won a grand prize: a week-long vacation during the Spring Festival on Australia's Gold Coast, where in December the weather was warm, and the sea was as beautiful as a mirror.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">All expenses paid.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"You're invited to spend an unforgettable Spring Festival on the Gold Coast with your family."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye verified the authenticity of the information. It was all true.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Dazed, she returned home, where Yun Yifan greeted her with a big bear hug.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Ah Ye, you wouldn't believe how smoothly my experiment went today! Let me tell you..."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye listened as Yun Yifan excitedly rambled on.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He deliberately left out some details, only talking about the most concrete parts of the experiment—like what kind of substance he had created and how it functioned.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But they both knew everything he did was aimed at one goal:</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Cloning life.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The two of them had never reached a consensus on the matter. After a few arguments, they tacitly agreed not to bring it up again.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye studied applied physics; Yun Yifan studied life sciences.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">They had been drawn to each other by each other's brilliance in university, eventually falling in love. Everything progressed so smoothly. It was no surprise that they both became young and promising scientists. Everyone considered them a golden couple.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But the signs had always been there—no one had noticed.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Their first date was on a grassy slope on a mountain peak. Their university was backed by this mountain, with beautiful scenery. They had many dates there, with endless conversations.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Does this mountain have a name?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye had asked once.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. You can give it one. I don't think it would mind an extra name."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Let's call it 'Oasis.'" Bai Ye spread her arms, facing the wind, and shouted, "Science is the most beautiful oasis in the human world!"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Once, Bai Ye noticed a scar in the center of Yun Yifan's lips.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">It was faint, so she only noticed it then for the first time.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She asked Yun Yifan, "What's this?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan touched his lips. "This is why I study this subject."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"The reason?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"When I was born, there was a deep, deep cleft here. It's called a cleft lip."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"But now you can barely see it."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"You can't imagine how many surgeries I had in the hospital." Yun Yifan licked his lips. "Seven."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"That must've been painful," Bai Ye said.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan shook his head. "Many people have suffered more than me. So much more. And there are many children with heart, limb, or brain defects. They're so small, just tiny little beings. I asked adults what caused this, and they just said, 'There's no reason.'"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"I kept asking, and eventually, the adults said it was genes. Everyone is born with their genes, and there's nothing that can be done about it."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"When I got to high school, I realized that something could be done. It's just that current technology isn't advanced enough."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Gene editing," Bai Ye said.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Exactly." Yun Yifan gazed at her tenderly, softening Bai Ye's heart.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">At that time, Bai Ye didn't know she would one day pour all her effort into nano-filaments.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The softest thing in the world—so soft that it could kill without any resistance.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He saw through her, envisioning the millions of lives that would be saved.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">In that moment, Bai Ye knew she loved this boy.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">They silently gazed at each other, then up at the sky. The stars were vast, like untouched scientific territory.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Their differences emerged when Yun Yifan turned to cloning life.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Gene editing was like repairing a broken-down SUV, inspecting every old part. But cloning was different—with just one factory, brand new, beautiful cars could be mass-produced.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan's goal was to clone animals, and eventually humans—identical, even down to their memories.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"What a perfect idea! From now on, human society would be free from suffering. No sickness, no partings, no death..."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"I don't think so." Bai Ye doused Yun Yifan's excitement about his new project with a cold bucket of water.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"I don't think they'd be 'alive.' The original, conscious being full of love—that life is dead. You can't change that fact."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"An identical lifeform with the same genes and memories—and then? You erase the existence of the previous one, as if it never existed. Yun Yifan, you're fooling yourself."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye said.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"You're building tombstones—living, breathing tombstones. They move, cry, and laugh, but they are tombstones."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"They constantly remind you of death."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan rarely got angry.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But that day, he was furious.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">They parted on bad terms.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Neither could persuade the other, and they still loved each other.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan chose not to mention cloning again, and Bai Ye decided to ignore it—cloning life was a long journey, and Yun Yifan could only take a small step, if any.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye didn't think he could achieve it.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye tossed and turned in bed.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She reflected on everything that had happened that day. After the tides of joy receded, she felt an extraordinary clarity in her mind.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Something was off.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But what exactly…?</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Physics is like a meticulously designed castle, and the world is the reflection of that castle on the surface of a lake, where everything aligns seamlessly.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Everything in the world is like a symphony.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye could sense that one note was out of tune.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">…</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">In the darkness, she suddenly sat up.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The size and shape of the snowflakes, the frequency at which they fell.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Humans cannot simulate nature's true randomness; all artificial randomness follows patterns.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">As long as you observe it from an infinitely large dimension.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She knew snow too well...</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">It was her favorite weather. She could spend hours staring at heavy snow, tracking the subtle paths of each flake.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The snowflakes were encoded.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">#</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The next day, when Bai Ye arrived at the lab, she went straight to look for the spectrometer.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She couldn't find it. Later, she was told that the spectrometer had been taken away.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The manufacturer said it needed to be sent back for repairs.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Something was wrong with the spectrometer. As for what the problem was, even the technicians couldn't say. It was as if their minds had been imprinted with a command: "It must be taken away. It must be taken away. It must..."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">All the spectrometers in Beijing had been mysteriously taken away.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">This was a fundamental instrument in physics experiments, yet overnight, all of them had vanished.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye looked at her still-busy colleagues, and a chill crept up her spine.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">No object in motion can make a sharp turn without a curve.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Life is like a high-speed train that never stops.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The behavior of all living things always leaves a trace.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Everything was collapsing like a row of dominoes.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Some invisible force was desperately trying to stop Bai Ye from discovering something.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">After she noticed the anomaly in the snowflakes, the entire world began spiraling out of control like a rollercoaster in free fall.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">And on this rollercoaster, aside from her, everyone else was just a puppet.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Now she was certain.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">All the instruments were unusable. The lab was paralyzed. Bai Ye built a detector from simple materials.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She compared the data she collected with that of natural Earth.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">While she did all of this, the world remained silent.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Everything here felt like a crude imitation of the "past."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Not one year, not ten years, but hundreds.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">It was like using modern technology to imitate the bronze vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She knew that "it" had given up.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The moment she grew suspicious, the world became like a poorly constructed lie, or a soap bubble ready to pop at a single touch.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Now, "it" was merely quietly, silently, observing her every move from somewhere out of sight.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">In the end, Bai Ye tossed the detector aside and said, "Let's talk."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Her voice was low, but she knew "it" could hear her.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She sat on the snow-covered grass on the slope of "Oasis Peak." The soft breeze brushed through her hair.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">There was no reply.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"I don't want to die knowing nothing," Bai Ye said.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Thin cardboard collapsed with a resounding crash.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Outside the cardboard, a dim world awaited.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">No sun, no snow, no grass, no color.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">In the center of this gray expanse stood Yun Yifan.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">A Yun Yifan who had aged into a mere shadow. Bai Ye couldn't imagine a person could grow that old.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But she still recognized him.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan, leaning on a cane, slowly walked into this colorful world.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He seemed distant, yet near. His steps were slow, but in an instant, he was beside Bai Ye, struggling to sit down.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Where is this?" Bai Ye asked.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"I call it the 'Oasis.' This is a…virtual space," Yun Yifan shook his head. "It's too hard…I've thought of everything I could, but Earth…I couldn't make it flawless."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Silence.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Of course, Bai Ye remembered that day. She had said that science was humanity's oasis, so was this Yun Yifan's version of an oasis?</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">This world was both cruel and beautiful, but it was objective. Why did you insist on being a creator? Bai Ye wanted to ask.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But she didn't. Instead, she asked, "How long has it been?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"I don't remember."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan only remembered endlessly extending his telomeres. At some point, he no longer dared to look in the mirror.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"What's outside?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"A four-dimensional world."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Four-dimensional?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Yes, beyond the solar system. Do you want to see it?" Yun Yifan asked, a flicker of light in his clouded eyes. Bai Ye shook her head, and that flicker faded.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"I'm a clone, right?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan glanced at her before quickly lowering his head. But that was enough for Bai Ye to understand.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She smiled gently, "Yifan, it's okay. You can look at me. I'm not afraid."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Through the monster-like eyes of this old man, she saw the soft and gentle eyes of the boy from thousands of years ago.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"What happened after that?" Bai Ye asked after a while, her tone calm.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"You couldn't stop the war," Yun Yifan closed his eyes. His voice was hoarse and ancient, almost unrecognizable. "Nano-filaments were used in warfare, leading to a chain reaction that destroyed several biological labs, killing millions."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"You began taking antidepressants. We even had a dog, named Wangwang. Later, Wangwang died from the virus released from those biological labs."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">After that, in the endless stretch of time, Yun Yifan had fantasized countless times—if he had spoken to Bai Ye one more time before she left, if he had cared more about her daily work and life, if he had climbed that mountain with her…</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But there were no "ifs." When he saw the message his wife had sent three hours earlier, saying she had boarded the plane and wished him luck with his experiment, he simultaneously received a call from the police.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">His wife had committed suicide by jumping off the peak.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Holding the phone, he didn't know what to say. He turned to look at Wangwang, the cloned dog, who barked softly. It was meant to be a surprise gift for Bai Ye, so instead of gene editing, he poured all his energy into cloning—not just the body, but also its memories.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He would never know what Bai Ye would have said when she saw the new Wangwang.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But deep down, he knew. Bai Ye would say—</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"That's not Wangwang. Even though all its genes and memories are the same, it's a different dog."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Wangwang was forever gone.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">…</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan looked into the warm, gentle eyes of his wife.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He would give anything to preserve that lake of tranquility.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">But there was no way.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Death.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Death.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Death.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Death.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Death.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Like an inescapable whirlpool.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye stood up gracefully. She looked at Yun Yifan and said, "Yifan, this is a dead end."</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">"Promise me, don't go on, okay?"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">There was a cruel tenderness in her eyes.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Then Bai Ye jumped from the peak, like a white bird.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan turned and walked toward the edge of the world.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye had promised long ago to go with him to see the sea. She had promised, but he had never seen the sea.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">He still remembered her saying that the sea in Brisbane looked like gold, so beautiful.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Once again, she broke her promise.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The tear in his eye glistened for a moment, but it was soon replaced by something else.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The peak was high, but Bai Ye fell quickly. The gravity here was the same as Earth's.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The valley was shrouded in mist.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">As she drew closer, she saw the valley filled with countless…</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Corpses.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">She saw them clearly.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Countless corpses of Bai Ye, most of them decayed, some still fresh.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The valley floor was packed with these corpses, like a mass of insect eggs.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Bai Ye floated down gently, like a red flower blooming briefly.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">#</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan returned to the control room. A younger Yun Yifan followed behind, still incessantly asking about cloning life.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">His enthusiasm wasn't dampened by the older man's indifference.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">In the end, the young Yun Yifan asked, "Where's A-Ye? Is she waiting for me outside? What's her reaction, she…"</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan didn't answer. He said, "Go in." The young Yun Yifan didn't hesitate and stepped into a capsule-like device.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Right until the moment he was vaporized, he was still eagerly asking about everything in the world.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The final sound hung in the air, like a strange pause.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Yun Yifan didn't care about any of it. Leaning on his cane, nearly collapsing in his greed, he lunged toward the holographic monitor.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">In the clean, warm bedroom he had lain in thousands of years ago, a new Bai Ye slowly opened her eyes.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify">#</p>
